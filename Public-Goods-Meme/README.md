## Challenge Description
The scope of this prize is to create a template for public goods memes.

Why Today, awareness and recognition of public goods is quite subliminal. Many people understand that public goods are good only when they are gone. For example, they understand the value of clean air only when the sky is smokey orange-grey, or the value of public health only when medical facilities are overloaded.

As RadicalxChange (RxC) and concepts like Quadratic Funding, Quadratic Voting and Common Partial Ownership foster promising alternatives for more democratic and sustainable public goods ecosystems - compared to traditional approaches found in capitalism and nation-states - we think it is important to get everybody on the same page about …

What public goods are,
How public goods are produced,
Why public goods are valuable.
How Internet memes are social and cultural phenomena that have attracted high public interest in a growing number of communities on the Internet.

We hope that a meaningful template for memes about public goods accelerates the understanding and excitement about public goods in the Internet at large.

What The challenge at hand is to create a clever and expressive template for Internet memes that explain the nature and value of public goods.

By “template” we mean a specific meme format that people can continue to apply to their individual memes, or explanations, for public goods. The characterizing aspect of the template can be its overall structure or specific text images or humor. Here is generic, typical meme template. Please come up with a similar construct that incorporates non-moving images and text.

That way, it’s easier for RxC community members to make memes based on your template. The simple combination of image and language is at the heart of meme’s popularity.

Scope Your submission must include three examples of public goods memes that correspond to the template that you have in mind. The formal and contextual punch line of the template must be recognizable by mere analysis of the three examples.
